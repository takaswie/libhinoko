## Instruction

This is a sister project of libhinawa.
https://github.com/takaswie/libhinawa

I design this library for userspace applications to transfer/receive
isochronous packets on IEEE 1394 bus by any language binding of GObject
Introspection. The applications is able to operate OHCI 1394 controllers
for any isochronous context. According to this design, this library is
an application of Linux FireWire subsystem and GLib/GObject.

## Example of Python3 with PyGobject
